Based on my analysis of the current ALT5 integration and documentation, I can see the core issue: **the current implementation is completely backwards**. 

## Current State Analysis

### ❌ What's Wrong:
- **Current ALT5 integration** creates wallets for users to **send crypto TO ALT5** (off-ramp)
- **ALT5 on-ramp routes** are just mocks that don't use ALT5's actual custodial APIs
- **FX swap system** is designed for Stripe + DEX flows, not ALT5's custodial model

### ✅ What ALT5 Actually Offers:
From the documentation, ALT5 provides a **custodial payout service** where:
- User pays ALT5 via credit/bank transfer
- ALT5 converts fiat → USDT internally  
- ALT5 sends USDT directly to user's wallet address
- Professional rates (2% fees vs retail 3-5%)
- Webhook notifications for payment confirmations

### 🎯 Target Flow (What You Want):
```
User pays ALT5 via bank/card → ALT5 converts → ALT5 sends USDT to user wallet
```

### 🔄 Current Flow (What Exists):
```
User sends crypto to ALT5 wallet → ALT5 converts → User gets fiat  
```

## Comprehensive Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Core ALT5 On-Ramp Implementation
1. **Create ALT5 Custodial Order API** - Use ALT5's order creation endpoint for fiat→crypto
2. **Implement Proper Webhook Handling** - Handle ALT5's payment confirmations  
3. **Update Database Schema** - Create tables for ALT5 custodial orders
4. **Add Payment Status Tracking** - Real-time status updates from ALT5

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing  
5. **Replace Mock On-Ramp Routes** - Connect to real ALT5 custodial APIs
6. **Add Error Handling** - Proper failure recovery and user notifications
7. **Implement Rate Optimization** - Use ALT5's professional rates effectively
8. **Add Monitoring** - Track conversion success rates and performance

### Phase 3: User Experience
9. **Update Frontend Components** - Show ALT5 on-ramp options
10. **Add Payment Method Selection** - Bank transfer, card, wire options
11. **Implement Order Tracking** - Real-time status for users

## Key Technical Changes Needed

### 1. New ALT5 Custodial Service
- Replace wallet creation with order creation APIs
- Handle fiat payment methods (bank, card, wire)
- Process ALT5 webhooks for confirmations

### 2. Database Schema Updates  
- New tables for ALT5 custodial orders
- Track fiat payments and crypto deliveries
- Audit trail for compliance

### 3. API Flow Changes
- `POST /create-order` → ALT5 custodial order (not wallet creation)
- Webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Status checking via ALT5's order APIs

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this fix? The core issue is that we're using ALT5's APIs backwards - we need to switch from their "receive crypto" APIs to their "send crypto" custodial APIs.
